Riddhi Mittal,Co-Founder at Finomena - recruiting awesome folks!,Internet,"Bengaluru Area, India","Youve stumbled across the profile of someone with too many diverse interests, and too little time to accomplish all her goals in life.

I have had wonderful opportunities to work alongside the best talent in Silicon Valley and now Im back in India, building out my team for Finomena, and spending many hours thoughtfully ensuring a Silicon Valley style meritocratic culture. If youre awesome, you should reach out and apply right now!

I consider myself a fortunate combination of a right-brained creative, big picture thinker and ideator who can subsequently zoom in, and become a left-brained analytical, detail-oriented, perfectionist. Of course, I now prefer iterating on imperfections over perfection that takes too long anyday.

I love speaking with people, understanding what makes them tick, and figuring out how to get the very best out of them. Im the perennial motivator, telling everybody everything is possible, and goading them on to try. :) If youre sad about something in life, give me a call, and by the end of it, you will be thinking about endless possibilities again!

My past experiences involve being a kick-ass (and really talkative) full-stack software engineer, a venture capital associate who spent way too much of her spare time giving honest feedback to deserving entrepreneurs, a product manager whose team consisted of people far older to her in age and experience and yet she added strong leadership oversight and value.

I moved back to India because I wanted to make an impact here. 

Knowing a million different things increases my creativity, and increases cross pollination of great ideas from one discipline to another.","

I believe technology will play a very big role in changing the traditional HR practices and will create a new, effective and efficient work culture.


Being equally interested in Coding and Business Knowledge I believe I can contribute significantly to this ongoing change in HR space. My knowledge and my competencies will help organisations to manage change and undergo a transformation.


Currently, I am looking forward to a Human Resource Manager role in an Organization which has the flexibility and willingness to innovate, which wants to come out of their traditional horizon and works towards providing better Job Satisfaction, Employee engagement, and overall culture.","
